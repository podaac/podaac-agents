# podaac-agents

PO.DAAC Agents is an open, modular framework for building and deploying AI assistants that understand NASA Earth science data.

These agents can search, download data, test data, analyze data, explore data, reason, and act across PO.DAAC and NASA data services — making it easier for scientists, developers, and educators to explore and analyze ocean, climate, and geophysical datasets using natural language and automation tools.


## Future Agents to Come

- L2 Subset Test Agent (Example query: Test all PODAAC MODIS collections.  Only test the newest 5 granules located near California)
- Search Agent (Example query: Show me collections with sea surface temperature around Venture, CA)
- Explore Data Agent (Example query: What was the hottest ocean temperature day in 2025 in the Long Beach, CA?)

# Tools

Tools are currently empty, but this will be filled with helper tools to aid the agents

# Validation

An important step in Agentic services will be validation.  We must validate that the collections, granules, variable data being used are the ones that we requested, etc.
